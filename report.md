- **Session Management**: Per-session agent storage with automatic reset
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/chat/receptionist` - Primary patient interaction
  - `/chat/clinical` - Clinical consultation
  - `/patients/{name}` - Patient lookup
  - `/session/{session_id}/reset` - Conversation reset
  - `/health` - System health monitoring

#### 2. Receptionist Agent (`receptionist_agent.py`)
- **Purpose**: Initial patient interaction and identification
- **Capabilities**:
  - Natural name extraction using LangChain structured output
  - Conversational greeting adaptation
  - Medical concern detection and routing
  - Session state management with automatic reset
- **Technology**: ChatGroq LLM with Pydantic models

#### 3. Clinical Agent (`clinical_agent.py`)
- **Purpose**: Medical consultation and clinical guidance
- **Features**:
  - RAG-based medical knowledge retrieval
  - Patient-specific recommendations
  - Symptom assessment and triage
  - Source-referenced clinical responses

#### 4. Database Layer (`db.py`)
- **Patient Data Management**: JSON-based patient records
- **Search Capabilities**: Name-based patient lookup with fuzzy matching
- **Data Validation**: Multiple patient handling and error management

### Key Innovations

#### Natural Conversation Processing
```python
# Advanced name extraction with LangChain structured output
class NameExtraction(BaseModel):
    patient_name: str = Field(description="Full patient name")
    confidence: str = Field(description="High, Medium, or Low confidence")
    reasoning: str = Field(description="Extraction methodology")
```

**Supported Patterns**:
- "Hi, I am John Smith" ✅
- "Hello, my name is Alice Johnson" ✅
- "Good morning, I'm Michael Lee" ✅
- "Hey there, this is Emily Davis" ✅

#### Intelligent Session Management
- **Automatic Reset**: Conversation end detection with state cleanup
- **New User Detection**: Mid-conversation user switching
- **Contextual Responses**: Greeting adaptation based on interaction style

#### Multi-Level Fallback System
1. **Primary**: AI-powered structured extraction
2. **Secondary**: Regex-based pattern matching
3. **Tertiary**: Graceful error handling with user guidance
